    Setting up nodeJS
    
    g.Install nodeJs. I'm providing you with the latest installer - 'node-v12.16.1-x64.msi'
    h.During nodeJS installation make sure it is 'added to path'.
    
    Setting up MySQL server :

    i.Download mySQL server from googleDrive.(Please don't use the latest version as it was giving some connectivity issues with nodeJS)
    j.Create database named - 'resumeInfo'  with no password protection.
    k.Open routes/database.js file in text editor and enter your mysql root password inside the quotes in line 6
    l.Start mysql notifier (from start) and click on it in system tray and start mysql server.(If it's not already started)
    m.Start mysql 5.6 command line client and enter your mysql root password.
    n.create database 'resumeInfo'. (run command 'create database resumeInfo;') (It should return Query Ok)

    (I went with a lower version of MySQL server(5.6) because the latest version 8.0 required some server modifications that were giving connectivity issues with nodeJS, the 5.6 version seems to work just fine)


2. Running the server
    o.Go to the project folder ('brainChange'), open cmd and run node index.js (wait some time and it should 'Connect to the db')
    p.Then you can go to your webBrowser and go to 'localhost:3000' and the website should run.
    q.During running of the server if your PC is not connected to the web then the css won't load.

(Please do let me know in case of some difficulty)
